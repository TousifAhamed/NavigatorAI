# AI Travel Planner - Flight Search Enhancement Summary

## 🎯 TASK COMPLETED

**Objective**: Diagnose, fix, and enhance the AI Travel Planner's flight search tool so that it reliably calls the backend with correct city-to-SkyID mapping, robustly handles user queries (including malformed JSON), and ensures the agent requests missing flight details from the user when needed.

## ✅ PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED AND FIXED

### 1. **Agent Loop Issue** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Agent got stuck in an infinite loop when users asked for flights without providing complete information (origin, destination, dates).

**Root Cause**: Agent tried to take invalid actions like "I need to request the necessary flight information from the user" which wasn't in the tool list.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced the ReAct prompt template in `server.py` to explicitly handle missing information
- Added clear instructions to use `Final Answer` instead of invalid actions when information is missing
- Added examples of how to ask for missing information

### 2. **City-to-SkyID Mapping** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Flight search often failed due to incorrect city code mapping.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced `convert_city_to_skyid()` function in `tools.py` with comprehensive mapping of Indian and international cities
- Added support for city aliases (e.g., "Bombay" → "Mumbai" → "BOM")
- Added fallback mechanisms for unknown cities

### 3. **Malformed JSON Input Handling** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Agent sometimes passed malformed JSON to flight search tool.

**Solution**:
- Added JSON parsing and fixing logic in the `flight_search` tool
- Handles cases where entire JSON payload is passed as a single parameter
- Graceful fallback when JSON parsing fails

### 4. **Natural Language Query Processing** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Agent couldn't extract flight details from natural language queries.

**Solution**:
- Created `enhanced_flight_parser.py` with `FlightQueryParser` class
- Added `intelligent_flight_search` tool that can parse natural language queries
- Supports various date formats, city aliases, and passenger counts
- Automatically detects missing information and asks for it

## 🔧 KEY ENHANCEMENTS MADE

### 1. **Enhanced Agent Prompt** (`server.py`)
```python
HANDLING MISSING INFORMATION - USE FINAL ANSWER:
When users ask for tools but don't provide required information, skip the Action step and go directly to Final Answer:

Thought: The user wants [tool] but hasn't provided [missing info]. I need to ask for the missing information.
Final Answer: To [what they want], I need [specific missing information]. Could you please provide [what you need]?
```

### 2. **Improved City-to-SkyID Mapping** (`tools.py`)
- 40+ Indian cities with aliases
- 30+ international cities  
- Fallback mechanisms
- Debug logging for troubleshooting

### 3. **Intelligent Flight Query Parser** (`enhanced_flight_parser.py`)
Features:
- ✅ Natural language date parsing ("tomorrow", "next week", specific dates)
- ✅ City name normalization and alias handling
- ✅ Route extraction (from X to Y patterns)
- ✅ Passenger count extraction
- ✅ Missing information detection
- ✅ Example query generation

### 4. **Dual Flight Search Tools** (`tools.py`)
- `flight_search`: For structured queries with complete parameters
- `intelligent_flight_search`: For natural language queries that need parsing

### 5. **Enhanced JSON Error Handling**
```python
# Handle case where entire JSON might be passed as origin parameter
if isinstance(origin, str) and origin.startswith('{"'):
    try:
        import json
        parsed_input = json.loads(origin)
        # Extract parameters from parsed JSON
    except:
        # Graceful fallback
```

## 🧪 TESTING RESULTS

### Agent Behavior Tests:
✅ **Incomplete Query**: "Search for flights and share details"
- **Before**: Infinite loop with invalid actions
- **After**: "To search for flights, I need the origin city, destination city, and departure date. Could you please provide these details?"

✅ **Complete Query**: "Search for flights from Mumbai to Delhi on 2025-07-15"  
- **Before**: Sometimes failed due to city mapping issues
- **After**: Successfully converts cities to SkyIDs (Mumbai→BOM, Delhi→DEL) and performs search

### Flight Parser Tests:
✅ **Natural Language Parsing**:
- "flights from Mumbai to Delhi on 2025-07-15" → Complete, ready for search
- "Book flight from London to Paris tomorrow" → Complete, ready for search  
- "I need flights from New York to Tokyo for 2 passengers" → Missing: departure date
- "Find flights to Singapore" → Missing: origin city, departure date

## 💡 USAGE EXAMPLES

### Now Supported Queries:
✅ "Search for flights and share details" → Asks for missing info
✅ "flights from Mumbai to Delhi on 2025-07-15" → Direct search
✅ "Book flight from London to Paris tomorrow" → Parses date automatically
✅ "I need flights from New York to Tokyo for 2 passengers" → Asks for date
✅ "Find flights to Singapore" → Asks for origin and date

### Response Examples:
**Incomplete Query Response**:
> "To search for flights, I need the origin city, destination city, and departure date. Could you please provide these details? For example: 'flights from Mumbai to Delhi on 2025-07-15'"

**Complete Query Response**:
> "Found 5 outbound flights from Mumbai to Delhi on 2025-07-15:
> 1. ✈️ Air India - Price: INR 8,500..."
