# Flight Search Fix - COMPLETED ✅

## Problem Resolved

The original error was:
```
Making request to Ollama
Extracted Response Text: "I'm sorry, but I currently don't have the tools to provide real-time flight details."
JSON parse failed, attempting structured text parse
Error: Could not parse suggestions from text
```

## Root Cause

Flight search requests were being routed to `ItineraryPlannerTool` instead of `FlightSearchTool`, causing:
1. Ollama to respond with generic "no tools available" message
2. JSON parsing to fail on plain text response
3. Users unable to get actual flight data

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Import Error in app.py**
- Changed: `from tools.AmadeusFlightSearchTool import AmadeusFlightSearchTool` (non-existent)
- To: `from tools.travel_tools import FlightSearchTool` (correct)

### 2. **Added Dedicated Flight Search Mode**
- Added "Search Flights" option to mode selection
- Direct integration with FlightSearchTool
- Bypasses ItineraryPlannerTool completely for flight searches

### 3. **Enhanced Request Routing**
- Added flight-specific keywords detection
- Automatic mode switching for flight requests
- Improved user experience

## Test Results

**Before Fix:**
- ❌ Flight requests failed with JSON parsing errors
- ❌ No access to real-time flight data
- ❌ Poor user experience

**After Fix:**
- ✅ Direct flight search works
- ✅ Amadeus API integration active
- ✅ Real-time flight data available
- ✅ User-friendly interface

## Verification Steps

1. **Open app**: http://localhost:8501
2. **Select mode**: "Search Flights"
3. **Enter**: From="Bangalore", To="Bali"
4. **Click**: "Search Flights"
5. **Result**: Real flight data from Amadeus API

## Status: FIXED ✅

The Amadeus API integration now works correctly with direct flight search functionality, eliminating the JSON parsing errors and providing users with real-time flight data.
